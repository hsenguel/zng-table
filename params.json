{"name":"zng-table","tagline":"Another angularjs table implementation - simple but powerful","body":"## Welcome to zng-table\r\nThis project is another try to implement a simple but powerful table abstraction in angularjs. There are [some](http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/) [other](http://angulartable.com/) [implementations](http://lorenzofox3.github.io/smart-table-website/) implementations aiming for the same goal.\r\n\r\nThis approach tries to be as simple as it can be _without_ annoying you with any limitations like a static data model, a fixed position of the pagination (\"*sigh - i need a pagination, but i want it to be on the lower left side\") and so on.\r\n\r\n**This project is bloody beta**: Since i am a happy full time working employee i don't have that much time to put into this project. Nevertheless i surely try to release the main features step by step and as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### First showcase\r\n\r\n```\r\n// HTML\r\n<div ng-controller=\"DemoCtrl\">\r\n    <zng-table config=\"objTable\"></zng-table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n// Controller\r\n$scope.objData = [\r\n    {name: \"Joe\", mail: \"joe@mail.com\", \"uri\": \"http://joe.com\", 22}\r\n];\r\n\r\n$scope.objTable = zngTable.create()\r\n    .addField(\"Name\", \"name\")\r\n    .addField(\"Mail\", \"mail\")\r\n    .addField(\"Web\", \"uri\")\r\n    .addField(\"Visits\", \"visits\")\r\n    .setData($scope.objData)\r\n;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
