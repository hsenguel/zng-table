Welcome to zng-table
=========

This project is another try to implement a simple but powerful table abstraction in angularjs. This approach tries to be as simple as it can be _without_ annoying you with any limitations like a static data model, a fixed position of the pagination ("*sigh - i need a pagination, but i want it to be on the lower left side") and so on.

This project is bloody beta: Since i am a happy full time working employee i don't have that much time to put into this project. Nevertheless i surely try to release the main features step by step and as soon as possible.

There is also a project page available at http://nullpunkt.github.io/zng-table
